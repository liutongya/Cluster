There are several options:
1) not changing the code, starting with nIter0=0 and to replace
 the main pickup files with a set of initial conditons files 
  (pSurfInitFile= ..., hydrogThetaFile= ..., hydrogSaltFile= ..., 
  uVelInitFile= ..., vVelInitFile= ...) corresponding to what is stored 
 in the pickup file.
2) generate a "pickup_flt" file yourself. It's very similar to float
 initial condition file (if mapIniPos2Index is set to False); 
 But since you were probably prepared to use the default (which is 
  mapIniPos2Index=T), you will have do the conversion yourself when
 generating this pickup_flt file, that is to give float position in index 
 space instead of distances (and 1 file per tile, since this does not work 
 with global files).
3) modify flt_init_varia.F to read float initial conditions 
  even when nIter0 <> 0  and generate a modified "mitgcmuv" executable.
  You will used this modified executable to start the float simulation 
  but will have to return to the un-modified one to continue after a restart.
4) try this trick: since flt_init_varia.F does not recognize pickupSuff, 
  you could try the following:
  a) set nIter0=0 and pickupSuff= {the name of your pickup file} in 
     main parameter file "data", 3rd namelist.
  b) use normal float initial conditions file.
 let me know if this 4th solution does not work.
